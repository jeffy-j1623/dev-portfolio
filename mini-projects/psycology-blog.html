    <h1>Welcome to Exploring Psychology</h1>
    <p>In this blog, I dive into different psychological concepts, theories, and ideas that help us understand human behavior.</p>
    
    <h2>The Power of the Mind</h2>
    <p>The mind is a powerful tool that shapes our thoughts, actions, and experiences. Understanding the inner workings of the mind can help us understand why we act the way we do. As Carl Jung said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>"Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart."</b></p>

    <h3>The Subconscious Mind</h3>
    <p>Our subconscious mind plays a huge role in shaping our thoughts and behavior. According to Sigmund Freud, the subconscious mind is a storehouse of memories and feelings that influence our actions:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>"The subconscious mind is like a tape recorder, recording everything it experiences."</b></p>

    <h2>Understanding Cognitive Biases</h2>
    <p>Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. They often affect our decision-making and thinking. For example, the <b>confirmation bias</b> is a tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms our preexisting beliefs.</p>
    
    <h3>Example of Cognitive Bias:</h3>
    <p>Imagine reading an article that supports your opinion on a topic, but dismissing articles that challenge it. This is confirmation bias at work!</p>

    <h3>What is Psychology?</h3>
    <p>Psychology is often defined as the study of the mind and behavior. A popular way to put it is, <q>Psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and its functions, especially those affecting behavior.</q></p>

    <h2>Psychological Well-being</h2>
    <p><u>Taking care of your mental health</u> is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Engaging in activities that promote mental well-being, such as meditation, exercise, and talking to a therapist, can help improve overall happiness and resilience.</p>
